In the video, Randy Pausch Last lecture, He speaks about his childhood dreams, enabling the dreams, and lessons learned.
while going through the video. He speaks about his past and how he as a professor has also helped out others to make sure that he and his students were able to reach for their dreams. Through out we learn how he approached life and how others around him supported him such as his mom and dad letting him paint the walls in his room. At the end of the video he shows that the lecture wasn't a step by step of how to achieve your dreams but rather your approach on how you lead your life and mindset to even attempt those dreams. And not all dreams will be successful, such as earlier he mention how we wanted to be apart of the NFL. Of course this dream never came to fruition but it was a dream non-the-less.

For his message about how you lead your life determines whether you are able to achieve your goals reached out to me the most. As it is all about your mindset and how much work you are willing to put in to make sure that you can find success within yourself. This is especially true to me as an Artist and even Gamer. If I want to succeed and reach for my dream of being a known artist or hell, being a concept artist for game design. I have to work for it as it's not something that will plop into my lap without effort. I need to put myself out there and make myself known by taking a lead with not just mindset, but my life path in general.
