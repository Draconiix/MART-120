Taking the learning Style quiz. I learned that I am generally all rounded with how I learn. Having 40% in auditory whilst Visual and tactile were both 30%. I found this surprising as I have always found myself learning better visually and Tactile (Hands-on) as a means to remember rather than auditory.

But I do believe the styles in which we learn definitely affect the way we remember and retain information. Such as myself I have realized that through having ADHD I have a hard time remembering exact details if I was to have to read a book or simply be told the task in hand because my brain simply cannot comprehend everything at once and overstimulation is a real threat to my learning. Because of this having pictures and learning by getting hands-on makes me actually remember more than words on a page and allows me to jump back to that information later on without struggling the information that is needed.
