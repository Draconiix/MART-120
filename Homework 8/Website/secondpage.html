    <h1>My Favorite DnD Campaign story</h1>
    <p>My favorite story that came from a DnD campaign had to be my cyberpunk one.<br/>
        Where my character, Nesryn Koshavik, ended up dying and getting revived by a SOULKILL program.<br/>
        Where she would end up not being herself after the death and instead becoming two personalities merging into one.
